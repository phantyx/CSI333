The following code was my product of working through this course. 
Under the instruction of Michael Phipps, University at Albany, SUNY.
For the course ICSI333 - Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface.
All code was created for, and tested in a Bash console running Ubuntu 20.04.

Following are the prompts used for each objective and my goals are outlined there.
Additionally, my work produced while completeing these objectives are included.
Labs were approached with a means-to-an-end mindset while projects had a more professional approach to them.
Projects also have a reflection/potential re-structure idea proposal, or any revisions I thought of after submitting the assignment.
